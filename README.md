**Description:**
This repository contains a collection of basic C programs that I've created to practice and explore the capabilities of the C programming language. These programs demonstrate fundamental concepts like variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, functions, and more.

**Programs:**

* Here are the programs that are in the list and will be updated as I keep adding new programs
    1) for-loop : This code demonstrates basic nested loops in C to calculate the sum of two variables (r and c) and display the results along with their corresponding values. It iterates through two nested loops, one for the row r (1 to 3) and another for the column c 
                  (1 to 2).
 
    2)
     


This is how you can utilize the code I've in my repository
**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine. If you're unfamiliar with Git, you can download the ZIP file from GitHub.

2. **Compile and Run:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.
   - For each C program you want to run:
     * Compile the program using a C compiler like GCC: `gcc <program_name>.c -o <executable_name>` (Replace `<program_name>` and `<executable_name>` accordingly).
     * Run the executable: `./<executable_name>`

**Contributing**

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your own basic C programs! Here are some guidelines to keep things organized:

* Create new C files for your programs.
* Add your program name to the list above with a brief description.
* Follow consistent coding style and indentation for readability.
* Optionally, include comments within your code to explain its functionality.
